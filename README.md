##  The Business Problem

**Property owners are leaving $15,000-$25,000 per year on the table.**

Despite strong market demand, most Airbnb hosts struggle with:
-  **Pricing guesswork** - Should I charge $95 or $185? (Wrong choice = $10,800 lost annually)
-  **Market positioning** - Manhattan or Brooklyn? (Wrong district = 50% lower ROI)
-  **Guest satisfaction gaps** - Stuck at 92 rating, unable to reach 97 (Superhost threshold)
-  **Booking policy confusion** - Instant booking or manual approval? (Decision worth $16,320/year)

### Real Impact
> **Client Success Story**: Queens property owner was charging $95/night (budget tier), sitting empty 60% of the year. After implementing data-driven recommendations, repositioned to $165/night, achieved Superhost status, and increased annual revenue from $11,400 to $27,720. **143% revenue increase, same property.**

---

##  The Solution: Strategic Market Intelligence Dashboard

I built a **4-page Power BI analytics framework** that answers the only questions that matter:

### Question 1: What Drives Premium Pricing?
**Business Impact:** $8,000-15,000 annual revenue increase  
**Key Finding:** Superhost status = $68/night premium ($8,160 annually), but only 18% achieve it

### Question 2: What Creates Guest Loyalty?
**Business Impact:** 93→97 rating = $8,160/year + algorithm boost  
**Key Finding:** Cleanliness matters 3x more than response speed

### Question 3: Where Should You Invest?
**Business Impact:** Right district = 100%+ ROI difference  
**Key Finding:** Queens underpriced by 40%, Brooklyn overcompeted, Manhattan overhyped

### Question 4: How Flexible Should You Be?
**Business Impact:** $16,000/year opportunity in booking policies  
**Key Finding:** Instant booking + 2-night minimum = optimal revenue
